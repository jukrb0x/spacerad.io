Unreal Engine 5 has revolutionized game development with features like Nanite, Lumen, and MetaHumans. In this post, I'll share some tips for getting started.

## Prerequisites

Before diving in, make sure you have:

- A capable GPU (RTX 3060 or better recommended)
- At least 16GB RAM (32GB preferred)
- SSD storage (UE5 projects can be large)
- Windows 10/11 or macOS

## Installation

1. Download the **Epic Games Launcher** from [epicgames.com](https://www.epicgames.com/store/download)
2. Create an account or sign in
3. Navigate to the **Unreal Engine** tab
4. Install the latest version of UE5

## First Steps

### Create a New Project

When you launch UE5, you'll be greeted with the Project Browser. For beginners, I recommend:

- **Template**: Third Person
- **Blueprint vs C++**: Start with Blueprint, add C++ later
- **Starter Content**: Include it for learning

### Editor Overview

The UE5 editor has several key panels:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              Toolbar                     │
├─────────┬───────────────────┬───────────┤
│ Content │     Viewport      │  Details  │
│ Browser │                   │           │
│         │                   │           │
├─────────┴───────────────────┴───────────┤
│              World Outliner              │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Key Concepts

### Actors and Components

Everything in your level is an **Actor**. Actors are made up of **Components**:

- Static Mesh Component (visual geometry)
- Collision Component (physics)
- Blueprint Component (logic)

### Blueprints

Blueprints are UE5's visual scripting system. They're perfect for:

- Prototyping gameplay
- Creating interactive objects
- Learning engine concepts before diving into C++

## Next Steps

In future posts, I'll cover:

- Setting up a character controller
- Working with materials and shaders
- Introduction to Nanite and Lumen

Happy developing!
