Welcome to **Space Radio** — calling from the universe!

This is my new blog, rebuilt with [Astro](https://astro.build) from my previous Next.js site. The name "Space Radio" comes from the idea of broadcasting signals into the cosmos — sharing ideas, discoveries, and stories into the digital void.

## What to Expect

Here's what you'll find on this blog:

- **Game Development** — Insights from working with Unreal Engine, graphics programming, and game engine internals
- **Technical Deep-Dives** — Breaking down complex topics in programming and computer science
- **Life & Thoughts** — Reflections on learning, creating, and navigating the tech world

## Why the Rebuild?

The previous site served me well, but I wanted something:

1. **Faster** — Astro's island architecture delivers excellent performance
2. **Simpler** — Less JavaScript, more static content
3. **Modern** — Better tooling and developer experience

## Stay Tuned

More transmissions coming soon. Thanks for tuning in!

```typescript
console.log('Hello from Space Radio!');
```
